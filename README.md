# Web-Pregnancy-Tracker

This web application uses HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end as well as SQL and PHP for the backend. 

With three different portals, the user can either log in through the patient or doctor portal. The patient user can enter in pregnancies to track, see their perscriptions, and request/see appointments. The doctor user can perscribe medication, search patient records, and see their upcoming appointments. With the third portal, system admin, the user can create doctor accounts and edit/delete any record in the system.
